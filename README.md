# Arabic-forced-Tashkeel-Harakat
A quick and dirty FontForge Python script that combines each حرف with each حركة into a new single Glyph.

Useful for legacy softwares that do not render Harakat correctly.

Load the font you wish to use into FontForge and run the script. By default, new Glyphs will be created at the Private Use Area (PUA).

Then use the newly generated Glyphs to force the software to render Harakat.
